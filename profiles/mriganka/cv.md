Krazybee, `02/05/2019 - Now`, Bangalore, Technical Architect
----
Krazybee is a digital lending platform and NBFC that is heavily reliant on technology for all its operations and compliance.

* Used `Golang, MySql, AWS Lambda, SNS, SQS, API Gateway, Cloudwatch, ECS` etc.  
* Streamlined the backend development process. Introduced continuous integration using `github action` and `aws codebuild` that increased team velocity by 2x.
* Designed and implemented robust monitoring tools using offerings from `AWS Cloudwatch`. Also setup the process framework for monitoring. This improved response time for production incidents and freed up developer bandwidth across teams.
* Designed and delivered Video KYC solution to meet regulatory requirements in time. Handled operational requirements for the same (for sometime).
* Steered critical decisions around technology, design, architecture and coding.

* Implemented visual debugging capabilities like - Cursors, Triggers, Zoom, Waveform & plot rendering etc. for the new generation software platform for Tektronix oscilloscopes.
* Contributed actively in design discussions with overseas team. Pushed for changes in proposed designs for `localization` and got it through. Took over related work and completed in time. 
* Contributed both as an individual developer and also as a scrum master.


Huawei, `Jun 2015 - Jan 2016`, Bangalore, Senior Technical Lead
----
Huawei is a telecommunication giant that has many business verticals.

* **M2M Chipset Utilities**, `Jun 2015 - Jan 2016`
    * Used `C, C++, Qt, AOSP, JTAG`
    * Worked as `Senior Tech Lead` with a team of 4 developers and 1 Tech Lead.
    * This project involved developing utility libraries like http, smtp, cmux (over serial) for a low level chipset. The chipset runs embedded android (AOSP) on application processor. 
    * Also integrated device management modules into modem (running Qualcom REX OS on a separate processor).
    * Developed a CMUX client PC application with Qt and libcmux for serial port multiplexing. 
    * Mostly used C, cross compilers tool chains from ARM, JTAG for debugging using TRACE32 ICD. 
    * Contributed both as a technical leader as well as individual contributor in certain areas.

* **Mobile Broadband Product**, `Apr 2012 - May 2015`  	
    * Used `C++, Qt`
    * Worked as `Senior Tech Lead` with a team of 20 developers and 4 Tech Leads.
    * The team handled software product customization and delivery for USB Modems for global market. As a senior technical leader, was responsible for all technical aspects to ensure timely delivery with quality. This involved requirement analysis, design, code reviews, CI & CD setup and maintenance. Involved in communication with marketing, hardware, device driver and other teams and technical management of the India Software Development team to ensure timely delivery.

* **Soft WiFi Addon for USB Modem**, `April-2011 - March-2012`
    * Used `C++, Qt`
    * Worked as `Tech Lead` with a team of 3~5 developers.
    * Developed an utility addon for Huawei Mobile Broadband connection manager software which will enable user to share the internet connection over WiFi of the laptop to other devices. Involved in enrichment of the initial idea and feasibility study, requirement analysis. Created the high level design of the Software and partially implemented the key modules. Worked closely with dev and test team and tracked the project till product release.

* **Cloud Messaging Client using XMPP**
    * Used `C++, Qt`
    * Worked as `Tech Lead` with a team of 3~5 developers.
    * Developed a desktop client to work with Huawei cloud messaging service. This was shipped with huawei modem connection managers in open market.

* **Portable Connection Manager for USB Modem**, `April-2009 - March-2011`
    * Used `C++, Qt`
    * Worked as `Senior Developer` in a team of 6~8 developers.
    * This project involved developing a portable connection manager that comes with the USB modem and starts as we plugin the USB modem without any installation. Also once usage is complete, it leaves no trace on that computer. Adding an SD card to the device, even all user data can be stored in it. Moreover, user can carry all their favourite apps in the SD card (portableapps.com fromat) and use it in any computer without leaving any trace. All apps are run within the sandbox environment provided by the connection manager software. 
    * As a senior developer, implemented the key modules like application launcher, SD card security and platform utilities, involved in reviews and design discussions. Later handled post release customization support which involved a lot of interaction with marketing and third-party application vendors.

*  **UiOne Multimedia**, `April-2008 - March-2009`
    * Used `C, C++, BREW, BUIW, uiOne`
    * Worked as `Developer` in a team of 3 developers.
    * The project has already almost completed the initial coding phase. However, performance of the current system was very poor to be useable in a mobile device. Assigned the task to understand the existing design and code and improve the same of an acceptable performance. Since there was no good profiling tool available under the target environment, designed a selective profiling mechanism with \_penter and \_pexit hooks and used the same to identify the hot-spots. Improved the DB performance by optimizing the startup synchronization to continue in background. Updated DB schema for optimization. Replaced some time consuming SQL queries with in-memory operations with effective caching.

* **XML parser**, `2008/2009`
    * Used `C, REX-OS, QXDM, TRACE32 ICD` 
    * Worked as `Developer/Independent Contributor`.
    * Added support for Facets (/XSD Restrictions) in existing XML parser module for low end mobile devices. Independently understood the requirements, existing code base and implemented the same. Supported verification activities and released well before deadline.

* **Automated Test Tool - for Feature Phone**, `April-2006 - March-2008`
    * Used `C, C++, BREW, REX, QXDM, TRACE32 ICD` 
    * Worked as `Developer` in a team of 3 developers.
    * Objective was to deliver an automated test tool to automate the GUI and other test cases for Mobile Handset Applications in Huawei handsets. 
    * Involved from the very beginning including requirement discussion and initial prototyping and design discussion. 
    * Implemented key modules and delivered and maintained the same for use by different teams. 
    * Helped overseas teams to integrate the same in different product lines.
